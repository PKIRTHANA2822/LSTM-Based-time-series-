# Objective
- Forecast future values of a univariate (or multivariate) time series using an LSTM neural network to support planning, capacity management, and anomaly detection.
# Why This Project
- Captures temporal patterns (lags, trends, seasonality) better than naive methods.
- Handles nonlinearity that classic ARIMA-style models may miss.
- Operational value: improves demand forecasting, inventory, pricing, budgeting, and alerting.
# Step-by-Step Approach (Overview)
- Define the forecasting goal: horizon (e.g., next t steps), granularity (daily/weekly), and target(s).
- Collect & clean data: load with pandas, ensure consistent timestamps, handle missing/outliers.
- EDA: visualize series, trend/seasonality, stationarity, autocorrelation.
- Preprocess: scale features with MinMaxScaler, create supervised sequences (windowing), train/val/test split by time.
- Modeling: build LSTM (Keras Sequential), tune window size, units, layers, dropout, learning rate.
- Training: early stopping, checkpointing; monitor loss curves.
- Evaluation: RMSE/MAE/MAPE on validation/test, residual analysis, prediction plots.
- Forecasting: recursive or direct multi-step forecasts; inverse-transform to original scale.
- Deployment: save scaler + model; provide inference script; schedule retraining & drift monitoring.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (What to Do)
- Line plots of the raw series and rolling stats (mean/std).
- Decomposition into trend/seasonal/residual (optional).
- Histograms/boxplots to see distribution/outliers.
- Autocorrelation (ACF/PACF) to understand lags.
- Missingness & gaps summary.
- Change points or regime shifts (visual scan).
# Feature Selection (Time-Series Mindset)
- If univariate: the “features” are past lags; tune the lookback window (e.g., 24, 48, 72 steps).
- If multivariate: start with domain-relevant covariates (e.g., weather, promos), then:
- Drop highly collinear variables (correlation thresholding).
- Use model-based importance (Random Forest/XGBoost proxy) to down-select.
- Keep only features available at forecast time (no leakage).
# Feature Engineering
- Supervised framing: for each time t, X = [y_{t-n}, …, y_{t-1}], y = y_t.
- Rolling stats: moving averages, rolling std, rolling min/max.
- Calendar features: day-of-week, month, holiday flags (if causal).
- Lagged exogenous: shift known drivers to align with target.
- Scaling: fit MinMaxScaler on train only; persist scaler for inference.
- Normalization windows (optional): per-window z-score for nonstationary series.
# Model Training (Keras LSTM)
- Architecture (example)
- Input: (timesteps, n_features)
- LSTM(units=32–128) → optional second LSTM/Dropout → Dense(1)
- Loss/optimizer: mse with adam (start lr=1e-3, tune).
- Regularization: Dropout(0.1–0.3), reduce units if overfitting.
- Callbacks: EarlyStopping(patience=10, restore_best_weights=True), ModelCheckpoint.
- Batching: batch_size 16–64; epochs 50–200 (use early stopping).
- Reproducibility: numpy.random.seed(7) and set TF seeds if needed.
# Model Testing & Evaluation
- Splits: Train → Validation → Test (chronological).
- Metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE (report all; MAPE needs positive targets).
- Visuals:
- Predicted vs actual (line plot).
- Residual plot and residual ACF (look for autocorrelation).
- Learning curves (train/val loss).
- Backtesting: rolling-origin evaluation to simulate real-time forecasting.
- Baselines: compare against Naive (last value), Seasonal Naive, and simple SMA/EMA.
